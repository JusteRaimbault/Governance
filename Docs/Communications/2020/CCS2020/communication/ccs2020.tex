% The evolutionary theory for systems of cities at the macroscopic scale proposed by [1] suggests the existence of co-evolutionary dynamics in the trajectories of cities and their environment. In particular, transportation infrastructure connecting cities can in some cases co-evolve with them [2]. Understanding such processes is crucial for sustainable planning at large scales. The issue of the interplay between bottom-up emergence of urban dynamics and top-down planning of infrastructures is in that context relevant to study. We propose in this contribution a model of co-evolution for cities and transportation networks, with a focus on how transportation networks evolve. More particularly, we extend the model of [3] by introducing top-down governance agents which decide on investments in transportation links. The model simulates population trajectories of cities and network link speed trajectories, with two main modules: (i) spatial interaction modeling to determine growth rates of cities, and (ii) governance modeling for network evolution. Using a game-theoretic approach, macroscopic agents (such as governments or planning authorities) arbitrate stochastically between national and international investments, following a payoff-matrix considering optimal accessibility gains and collaboration costs, with probabilities obtained under the assumption of mixed strategies in a Nash equilibrium. Network investments are used to increase effective link speed by fixed increments. The model is applied to synthetic systems of cities, in a stylized configuration of two neighbor countries of comparable size. We systematically study model behavior with the OpenMOLE platform for model exploration and validation [4]. First exploration results suggest a strong qualitative influence of propensity to collaborate on trajectories of the full system, and that intermediate levels of international investments may be more optimal in terms of accessibility gains at fixed costs. In comparison to null model behavior obtained running the base model from [3], the introduction of top-down governance decisions also changes considerably model behavior. We also show that initial spatial conditions such as urban hierarchy significantly influence model outcomes [5]. This work illustrates how co-evolution models at this scale can be refined, opening research possibilities towards more complex or multi-scale models.

The issue of the interplay between bottom-up emergence of urban dynamics and top-down planning of infrastructures is in that context relevant to study.

% The model simulates population trajectories of cities and network link speed trajectories, with two main modules: (i) spatial interaction modeling to determine growth rates of cities, and (ii) governance modeling for network evolution.

$\rightarrow$ \textit{Extend the model of \cite{raimbault2020hierarchy} and \cite{raimbault2020modeling} with two governance levels (national and international) and the game theoretic cooperation module introduced by \cite{le2015modeling}}

	\item \justify Iterative macro-scale LUTI simulation model: at each time step
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Update spatial interaction flows
			\item Evolve cities populations depending on flows
			\item Evolve network speeds depending on link flows assigned in the network
		\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

}


\sframe{Cities populations}{

%The model operates at the macroscopic scale: basic units are cities, distributed in space and described by their population $P_i$. A spatial interaction model is used to estimate flows between pairs of cities as

Spatial interaction flows

\[
\varphi_{ij} \textrm{=} \left( P_i P_j \right)^{\gamma} \cdot \exp\left(- \frac{d_{ij}}{d_0}\right)
\]

% From these flows is computed a growth rate for cities, assuming that it is for one city proportional to the sum of flows to all other cities, such that

\bigskip
\bigskip

Assume growth rate of cities are proportional to cumulated interaction flows as


\[
\frac{P_i \left(t \textrm{+} \Delta t\right) - P_i\left(t\right)}{\Delta t} \propto c_{ij} \cdot P_i\left(t\right)^{\gamma} \cdot \sum_j P_j\left(t\right)^{\gamma} \cdot \exp\left(- \frac{d_{ij}}{d_0}\right)
\]


with $c_{ij}$ a multiplier parameter equal to $1$ if cities are in the same country and $c_0 \leq 1$ otherwise

% WITH FIXED EFFECT COUNTRY MULTIPLIER

% Flows between cities are then distributed into the network. We assume no congestion and that the shortest path is taken.


}

\sframe{Network}{


% Using a game-theoretic approach, macroscopic agents (such as governments or planning authorities) arbitrate stochastically between national and international investments, following a payoff-matrix considering optimal accessibility gains and collaboration costs, with probabilities obtained under the assumption of mixed strategies in a Nash equilibrium. Network investments are used to increase effective link speed by fixed increments.

%The set of deciders - which are the level of respective countries - evaluate the relevance of different infrastructure development options. More precisely, they have in a simplified setting the choice between an international collaboration and a strictly national infrastructure development. Let $Z^{\ast}_i$ be the optimal infrastructure in terms of accessibility gains for the country $i$ only, and $Z^{\ast}_C$ the optimal international infrastructure.
%Making the assumption that deciders aim at optimizing the accessibility gain, 

% - distinguish between national and international flows
% - link increase function: flow quantile, improve only if above (no decrease)


\begin{enumerate}
	\item Baseline model: self-reinforcment of link speed according to
	\[
	d_l\left(t \textrm{+} \Delta t\right) \textrm{=} d_l\left(t\right) \cdot \left[ 1 \textrm{+} \Delta t \cdot g_M \left( \frac{1 - \left(\frac{\varphi_l}{\varphi_0}\right)^{\gamma_N}}{1 \textrm{+} \left(\frac{\varphi_l}{\varphi_0}\right)^{\gamma_N}} \right) \right]	
	\]
	for links with $\varphi_l > \varphi_0$, where $\varphi_0$ corresponds to the $\varphi_0^{(q)}$ quantile of link flows
	\item Estimate for each country $k$ accessibility gains $\Delta Z_k^{(N)}$ and $\Delta Z_k^{(I)}$ obtained respectively with national $(N)$ and international $(I)$ flows, and corresponding construction costs $C_k^{(N)}$, $C_k^{(I)}$

% It also forces feasibility conditions on $J$ and accessibility gains to keep a probability. These are
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item $ J \leq \Delta X_{1 - i}(Z^{\star}_{C}) - \Delta X_{1 - i}(Z^{\star}_{1 - i})$, what can be interpreted as a cost-benefits condition for cooperation, e.g. that the gain induced by the common infrastructure must be larger than the collaboration cost;
%	\item $\Delta X_{1 - i}(Z^{\star}_{C}) \leq \Delta X_{1 - i}(Z^{\star}_{1 - i})$, e.g. that the gain induced by the common infrastructure must be positive.

\footnotesize

Parameters $\kappa, J$ are in practiced rescaled such that: (i) given a baseline model run, average cost absolute difference times $\kappa$ is a fixed proportion $k_0$ of average absolute accessibility difference; and (ii) collaboration cost $J$ yields a fixed probability $p_0$ computed on absolute average of the baseline run.
